# Cloud is free

> This is a guide based on our experiences getting into Cyber Security

- Free and Open Source
- Resources, tasks, and projects,etc
- Built from first hand experience

- Once done, you should have the technical knowledge for roles like:
- SOC Analsyst
- Cyber Secuirty Analyst
- Information Security Analyst

- We tried to keep it as general and using the most popular options (in terms of content, community, and jobs) as possible.
